            <p>Life at ASU is yours to create and define. It’s your connection point to discovery and opportunities
                that shape who you become. Every Me + Virginia journey unfolds a little differently and might not even
                be
                what you expected. It’ll be even better. The ASU has given rise to CEOs, Grammy award winning artists,
                New York Times best-selling authors, CFOs, U.S. Senators, U.S. presidential candidates, NASA scientists
                and all kinds of notable doers. We can’t wait to see what it sparks in you as you write your Me +
                Virginia story.</p>

        <section class="quote"> "Don't ever give up on yourself. Keep pushing because the change of guards is what
            life's
            all about. You've always got to stick with whatever you're into because you're day is going to come. You're
            day is <span>DESTINED</span>. If you walk away from that, whether you're just giving up... The greatest sin
            is fear and giving up."
